## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

**Project Name**: FeedbackHub

**Description**:  
FeedbackHub is a feedback platform designed for users to easily log feedback for a website, request new features, report bugs, and suggest improvements without requiring a login. The platform aims to provide a user-friendly interface where users can quickly submit feedback categorized by tags such as "Feature Request", "Bug", and "Issue". Users can also upvote posts to indicate their interest in specific features, ensuring that the most requested items are prioritized.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: **Next.js**  
  Justification: Next.js provides server-side rendering and static site generation, enhancing performance and SEO, crucial for a feedback platform with potentially transient users.

- **UI Framework**: **shadcn/ui**  
  Justification: This framework offers a modern design system that is easy to implement, making it suitable for creating a simple yet aesthetic UI.

- **Deployment Platform**: **Vercel**  
  Justification: Vercel is optimized for Next.js applications, offering seamless deployment workflows and optimized performance.

- **No Backend or Database**:  
  Justification: As a startup MVP, we can leverage client-side solutions and external APIs for data management without the complexity of managing a backend or database.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

1. **Feedback Submission**  
   - Users can submit feedback without logging in.
   - Each submission requires a title, description, and selectable tags (e.g., Feature Request, Bug, Issue).
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Users can submit feedback with valid inputs. Invalid inputs trigger appropriate error messages.

2. **Feedback Filtering**  
   - Users can filter submissions by type (tag), date, and upvotes.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Filtering works dynamically, updating the displayed feedback list based on selected criteria.

3. **Upvoting System**  
   - Users can upvote feedback submissions to indicate their support for specific features.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Upvotes are accurately counted and displayed. Users can only upvote each submission once.

4. **Responsive Design**  
   - The platform must be optimized for both mobile and desktop.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: The UI maintains usability and readability across various screen sizes.

5. **Tagging System**  
   - Each feedback post must display its associated tags clearly.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Tags are visually distinct and clickable for filtering.

## ðŸ§ª Stretch Goals

1. **Login Option with Thirdweb**  
   - Integrate Thirdweb to allow users an optional login experience via a connect button.
  
2. **Search Functionality**  
   - Implement a search bar that allows users to search posts by keywords.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

1. Users can submit feedback with valid data.
2. Feedback is tagged correctly and displayed in a list format.
3. Users can filter and sort feedback based on type, date, and upvotes.
4. Upvote functionality works as intended.
5. The application is responsive and usable on mobile and desktop devices.

## ðŸ”§ Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   `git clone <repository-url>`

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:  
   `cd feedbackhub`

3. **Install dependencies**:  
   `npm install`

4. **Run the development server**:  
   `npm run dev`

5. **Open the application**:  
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture Notes

- **Client-Side Rendering**: The application will utilize Next.js's capability to render pages on the client side, improving load times for users.
- **Static Assets**: All images and icons will be stored in the `/public` directory for easy access.
- **Third-Party API Integration**: Future integrations with external APIs will be placed in the `/api` folder for modularity.
- **State Management**: Use React's Context API or local state management to handle upvotes and feedback submissions efficiently.

## Non-Functional Requirements Focus

1. **Performance**:  
   The application is designed to handle less than 100 users simultaneously with a response time of less than 2 seconds for feedback submissions and filtering.

2. **Security**:  
   Basic web security will be implemented, including input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.

3. **Data Privacy**:  
   No personal user data will be collected since login is not required. Feedback submissions will be anonymized.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:  
   Implement basic logging using console logs for user interactions and errors. Consider using Vercel's built-in monitoring tools for performance insights.

5. **CI/CD Considerations**:  
   Set up Vercel for automatic deployment from the main branch on GitHub. Ensure that build and deployment processes are configured to catch errors before going live.
